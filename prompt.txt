This was created by Claude Code with one prompt.  I dictated the prompt with Super Whisper, hence the mistakes in grammar.

---

This is a completely empty python project.  I want to use this project to create
an experiment with Llama index.

When using the LlamaIndex postgres vector store class it will handle the table 
schema creation for us.

This is convenient for most projects, but it only allows you to store attributes
about a chunk of text in the metadata column. I want to be able to have more
control over the columns. I want to be able to create foreign keys. Basically, I
want to be able to control the schema of the table that LamarIndex creates, but
ideally, still be able to use the LamarIndex Postgres vector store with its
standard interface that is compatible with the rest of LlamaIndex.

You can use the context7 documentation tool to better understand the llama index
classes or look in the .venv folder at the source code.

Please think carefully and make a plan for how we can achieve this goal
